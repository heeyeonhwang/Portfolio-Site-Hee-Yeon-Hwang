              <h2>1. The Challenge</h2>
              <p>Ink Tank was a six month project created for the CareerFoundry UX Design Certification. It is an app for tattoo lovers to find tattoo design inspirations and nearby artists. Ink Tank was created to help users streamline the process from filtering through categories such as specialties, prices, and reviews, to comparing artists and booking sessions by using design thinking and user-centered design.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            <div>
              <h2>2. Research </h2>
              <p>For Ink Tank, I spent a lot of time conducting initial competitive analysis and analyzing 71 surveys and four interviews through affinity mapping. This initial analysis showed what users’ needs and wants with Ink Tank and led me to prioritize the big features such as a filtering system for tattoo artists based on their location, price, and reviews. This focus on the features made my prototyping process quick and I created many iterations to further improve on Ink Tank. </p>
              <p>However,  I personally was not well versed in the tattoo culture. I only had limited amount of friends who had experience with tattoos and I had no one in my contacts as a tattoo artist. This problem affected my sample pool for user research but  eventually got help from the tattoo community by posting the survey on Reddit r/tattoos.</p>

              <h2>3. User Personas</h2>
              <p>Two user personas were created with the research analyses. Creating Janice and Bryan further made me focus on Ink Tank’s core features, filtering system based on artists’ specialties, reviews, price, and location, and an easy booking system with the artist.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2>4. User Flows & Sitemap</h2>
              <p>User flows and the sitemap were created for Janice and Bryan’s objectives. The sitemap of Ink Tank was revised after the card sorting analysis. Five participants participated an open card sort via Optimal and each session took about three and a half minutes each. Card sorting for the sitemap helped include more connections to each feature that I had not originally thought of before.</p>

              <h2>5. Wire-framing</h2>
              <p>The initial wire-frame was created via Figma for both mobile and desktop versions of Ink Tank. However the later iterations were created via Adobe XD. The wire-framing process started as a challenge because Figma and Adobe XD were new programs to me. My process in learning these new software was mostly through  trial and error.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div>
            <div>
              <h2>6. Usability Testing</h2>
              <p>The usability test results showed us that Ink Tank still needed improvements on its user experience design. The main problem it faced was the confusion of the hamburger icon to filter through search categories. All six participants encountered challenges figuring out this feature. Changing the hamburger icon into a universally recognized filter icon helped users understand the filter features of the app. </p>

              <h2>7. Final Mock-up</h2>
              <p>Throughout the iterative process for Ink Tank, the overall transformation focused on making it as minimal as possible. Since the app showcases a variety of colorful and busy pictures of tattoos, the rest of the app needed a step back. The minimalism was pushed mostly by following the Material Design guidelines. Material Design taught me about prioritizing certain aspects of Ink Tank to minimize the design of the rest of the features.</p>

              <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/91c9f3b0-c198-4c54-6afc-199bfdba4e65-e7f8/">
                <p>Click here for the clickable prototype of Ink Tank.</p>
              </a>
              <p>The next big step for Ink Tank would be to figure out a feature to separate users into two categories. The tattoo artists who are promoting their work to book sessions and the clients who are browsing through tattoos and artists. The artist account would have options in their user profile to upload and edit new pictures and bios as well as configure their availability to schedule for sessions. This feature will help the artists tailor their pages to gain more clients. </p>
